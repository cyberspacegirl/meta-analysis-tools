# Generating Search Terms
A simple Python script that produces a frequency count of words used across a set of text files.

This is useful for generating search queries by helping to get a sense of the most commonly used terms across a representative sample of manuscripts on a topic.

## Getting Started
The script is intended to work on a directory containing only text files. For example, each text file may include the title and abstract of a manuscript. Text files can be named whatever you like.

The location of the folder containing text files is currently `../data/seed-papers`, although this can be changed on line TK in TK.

To run this script, simply type TK in the command line.

Output is stored as a csv file in `../data/seed-papers/frequency-count.csv`.
